# Off_Board Blink
This program was used to program the microprocessor in order to be used on a breadboard.  This is a good demonstration of programmed processors can be programmed, then soldered into PCB's for permanent use.

## Supported Microprocessors
* MSP430G2553

## Specifications
The program Multiple Blink was reused for this.  The MSP430G2553 IC was removed and put on a bread board.  The circuitry from the microcontroller was simulated on the breadboard.  The power was taken from the micro controller to power the processor.  This is seen in the GIF.
